Would, for the\\nking's sake, he were living! I think it would be\\nthe death of the king's disease.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nHow called you the man you speak of, madam?\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was\\nhis great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nHe was excellent indeed, madam: the king very\\nlately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he\\nwas skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge\\ncould be set up against mortality.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nA fistula, my lord.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nI heard not of it before.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nI would it were not notorious.

I have those hopes of her good that\\nher education promises; her dispositions she\\ninherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where\\nan unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there\\ncommendations go with pity; they are virtues and\\ntraitors too; in her they are the better for their\\nsimpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\n'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise\\nin. The remembrance of her father never approaches\\nher heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all\\nlivelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;\\ngo to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect\\na sorrow than have it.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nI do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nModerate lamentation is the right of the dead,\\nexcessive grief the enemy to the living.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nIf the living be enemy to the grief, the excess\\nmakes it soon mortal.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nMadam, I desire your holy wishes.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nHow understand we that?\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nBe thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\\nIn manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue\\nContend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\\nShare with thy birthright!

Be comfortable\\nto my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nFarewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of\\nyour father.\\nExeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nO, were that all! I think not on my father;\\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\\nI have forgot him: my imagination\\nCarries no favour in't but Bertram's.\\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\\nIf Bertram be away. 'Twere all one\\nThat I should love a bright particular star\\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me:\\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\\nThe ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\\nMust die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,\\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\\nIn our heart's table; heart too capable\\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour:\\nBut now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy\\nMust sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?\\nEnter PAROLLES\\nAside\\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake;\\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\\nYet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,\\nThat they take place, when virtue's steely bones\\nLook bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see\\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nSave you, fair queen!\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nAnd you, monarch!\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nAnd no.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nAre you meditating on virginity?\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me\\nask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how\\nmay we barricado it against him?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nKeep him out.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,\\nin the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some\\nwarlike resistance.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nThere is none: man, sitting down before you, will\\nundermine you and blow you up.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and\\nblowers up! Is there no military policy, how\\nvirgins might blow up men?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be\\nblown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with\\nthe breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It\\nis not politic in the commonwealth of nature to\\npreserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational\\nincrease and there was never virgin got till\\nvirginity was first lost. That you were made of is\\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost\\nmay be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is\\never lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nI will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nThere's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the\\nrule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,\\nis to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible\\ndisobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:\\nvirginity murders itself and should be buried in\\nhighways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate\\noffendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,\\nmuch like a cheese; consumes itself to the very\\nparing, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.\\nBesides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of\\nself-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose\\nby't: out with 't! within ten year it will make\\nitself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the\\nprincipal itself not much the worse: away with 't!\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nLet me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it\\nlikes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with\\nlying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't\\nwhile 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.\\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out\\nof fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just\\nlike the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not\\nnow. Your date is better in your pie and your\\nporridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,\\nyour old virginity, is like one of our French\\nwithered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,\\n'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;\\nmarry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nNot my virginity yet [         ]\\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\\nA mother and a mistress and a friend,\\nA phoenix, captain and an enemy,\\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;\\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,\\nThat blinking Cupid gossips.

Thy father's moral parts\\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty's.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\\nFirst tried our soldiership! He did look far\\nInto the service of the time and was\\nDiscipled of the bravest: he lasted long;\\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on\\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\\nTo talk of your good father. In his youth\\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\\nTo-day in our young lords; but they may jest\\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\\nEre they can hide their levity in honour;\\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\\nHis equal had awaked them, and his honour,\\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\\nException bid him speak, and at this time\\nHis tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him\\nHe used as creatures of another place\\nAnd bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,\\nMaking them proud of his humility,\\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\\nWhich, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now\\nBut goers backward.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nHis good remembrance, sir,\\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\\nAs in your royal speech.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nWould I were with him! He would always say--\\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\\nHe scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,\\nTo grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--\\nThis his good melancholy oft began,\\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\\nWhen it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,\\n'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\\nExpire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;\\nI after him do after him wish too,\\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive,\\nTo give some labourers room.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nYou are loved, sir:\\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nI fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,\\nSince the physician at your father's died?\\nHe was much famed.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\n                  Some six months since, my lord.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nIf he were living, I would try him yet.\\nLend me an arm; the rest have worn me out\\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;\\nMy son's no dearer.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nThank your majesty.\\nExeunt. Flourish\\n\\nSCENE III. Rousillon.

Get you gone, sirrah:\\nthe complaints I have heard of you I do not all\\nbelieve: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know\\nyou lack not folly to commit them, and have ability\\nenough to make such knaveries yours.\\n\\nClown\\n\\n'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWell, sir.\\n\\nClown\\n\\nNo, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though\\nmany of the rich are damned: but, if I may have\\nyour ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel\\nthe woman and I will do as we may.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\\n\\nClown\\n\\nI do beg your good will in this case.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nIn what case?\\n\\nClown\\n\\nIn Isbel's case and mine own.

If men could be contented to\\nbe what they are, there were no fear in marriage;\\nfor young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the\\nPapist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in\\nreligion, their heads are both one; they may jowl\\nhorns together, like any deer i' the herd.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?\\n\\nClown\\n\\nA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next\\nway:\\nFor I the ballad will repeat,\\nWhich men full true shall find;\\nYour marriage comes by destiny,\\nYour cuckoo sings by kind.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nGet you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.\\n\\nSteward\\n\\nMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to\\nyou: of her I am to speak.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;\\nHelen, I mean.\\n\\nClown\\n\\n     Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,\\nWhy the Grecians sacked Troy?\\nFond done, done fond,\\nWas this King Priam's joy?\\nWith that she sighed as she stood,\\nWith that she sighed as she stood,\\nAnd gave this sentence then;\\nAmong nine bad if one be good,\\nAmong nine bad if one be good,\\nThere's yet one good in ten.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWhat, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.\\n\\nClown\\n\\nOne good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying\\no' the song: would God would serve the world so all\\nthe year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,\\nif I were the parson.

Her matter was, she loved your son:\\nFortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put\\nsuch difference betwixt their two estates; Love no\\ngod, that would not extend his might, only where\\nqualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that\\nwould suffer her poor knight surprised, without\\nrescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.\\nThis she delivered in the most bitter touch of\\nsorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I\\nheld my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;\\nsithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns\\nyou something to know it.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nYou have discharged this honestly; keep it to\\nyourself: many likelihoods informed me of this\\nbefore, which hung so tottering in the balance that\\nI could neither believe nor misdoubt.

A drum so lost!\\nThere was excellent command,--to charge in with our\\nhorse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nThat was not to be blamed in the command of the\\nservice: it was a disaster of war that Caesar\\nhimself could not have prevented, if he had been\\nthere to command.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nWell, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some\\ndishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is\\nnot to be recovered.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nIt might have been recovered.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nIt might; but it is not now.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nIt is to be recovered: but that the merit of\\nservice is seldom attributed to the true and exact\\nperformer, I would have that drum or another, or\\n'hic jacet.'\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nWhy, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you\\nthink your mystery in stratagem can bring this\\ninstrument of honour again into his native quarter,\\nbe magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will\\ngrace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you\\nspeed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.\\nand extend to you what further becomes his\\ngreatness, even to the utmost syllable of your\\nworthiness.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nBy the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nBut you must not now slumber in it.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nI'll about it this evening: and I will presently\\npen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my\\ncertainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;\\nand by midnight look to hear further from me.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nMay I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nI know not what the success will be, my lord; but\\nthe attempt I vow.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nI know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of\\nthy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nI love not many words.\\nExit\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nNo more than a fish loves water. Is not this a\\nstrange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems\\nto undertake this business, which he knows is not to\\nbe done; damns himself to do and dares better be\\ndamned than to do't?\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nYou do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it\\nis that he will steal himself into a man's favour and\\nfor a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but\\nwhen you find him out, you have him ever after.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nWhy, do you think he will make no deed at all of\\nthis that so seriously he does address himself unto?\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nNone in the world; but return with an invention and\\nclap upon you two or three probable lies: but we\\nhave almost embossed him; you shall see his fall\\nto-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nWe'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case\\nhim. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:\\nwhen his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a\\nsprat you shall find him; which you shall see this\\nvery night.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nI must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nYour brother he shall go along with me.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nAs't please your lordship: I'll leave you.\\nExit\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nNow will I lead you to the house, and show you\\nThe lass I spoke of.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nBut you say she's honest.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nThat's all the fault: I spoke with her but once\\nAnd found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,\\nBy this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,\\nTokens and letters which she did re-send;\\nAnd this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:\\nWill you go see her?\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nWith all my heart, my lord.\\nExeunt\\n\\nSCENE VII. Florence.

The count he wooes your daughter,\\nLays down his wanton siege before her beauty,\\nResolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,\\nAs we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.\\nNow his important blood will nought deny\\nThat she'll demand: a ring the county wears,\\nThat downward hath succeeded in his house\\nFrom son to son, some four or five descents\\nSince the first father wore it: this ring he holds\\nIn most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,\\nTo buy his will, it would not seem too dear,\\nHowe'er repented after.\\n\\nWidow\\n\\nNow I see\\nThe bottom of your purpose.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nYou see it lawful, then: it is no more,\\nBut that your daughter, ere she seems as won,\\nDesires this ring; appoints him an encounter;\\nIn fine, delivers me to fill the time,\\nHerself most chastely absent: after this,\\nTo marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns\\nTo what is passed already.\\n\\nWidow\\n\\nI have yielded:\\nInstruct my daughter how she shall persever,\\nThat time and place with this deceit so lawful\\nMay prove coherent. Every night he comes\\nWith musics of all sorts and songs composed\\nTo her unworthiness: it nothing steads us\\nTo chide him from our eaves; for he persists\\nAs if his life lay on't.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nWhy then to-night\\nLet us assay our plot; which, if it speed,\\nIs wicked meaning in a lawful deed\\nAnd lawful meaning in a lawful act,\\nWhere both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:\\nBut let's about it.\\nExeunt\\n\\nACT IV\\nSCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.\\n\\nEnter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nHe can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.\\nWhen you sally upon him, speak what terrible\\nlanguage you will: though you understand it not\\nyourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to\\nunderstand him, unless some one among us whom we\\nmust produce for an interpreter.\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nGood captain, let me be the interpreter.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nArt not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nNo, sir, I warrant you.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nBut what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nE'en such as you speak to me.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nHe must think us some band of strangers i' the\\nadversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of\\nall neighbouring languages; therefore we must every\\none be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we\\nspeak one to another; so we seem to know, is to\\nknow straight our purpose: choughs' language,\\ngabble enough, and good enough. As for you,\\ninterpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,\\nho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,\\nand then to return and swear the lies he forges.\\nEnter PAROLLES\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nTen o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be\\ntime enough to go home. What shall I say I have\\ndone? It must be a very plausive invention that\\ncarries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces\\nhave of late knocked too often at my door. I find\\nmy tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the\\nfear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not\\ndaring the reports of my tongue.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nThis is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue\\nwas guilty of.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nWhat the devil should move me to undertake the\\nrecovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the\\nimpossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I\\nmust give myself some hurts, and say I got them in\\nexploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they\\nwill say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great\\nones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the\\ninstance? Tongue, I must put you into a\\nbutter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of\\nBajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nIs it possible he should know what he is, and be\\nthat he is?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nI would the cutting of my garments would serve the\\nturn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nWe cannot afford you so.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nOr the baring of my beard; and to say it was in\\nstratagem.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\n'Twould not do.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nOr to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nHardly serve.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nThough I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nHow deep?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nThirty fathom.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nThree great oaths would scarce make that be believed.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nI would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear\\nI recovered it.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nYou shall hear one anon.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nA drum now of the enemy's,--\\nAlarum within\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nThroca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.\\n\\nAll\\n\\nCargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nO, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.\\nThey seize and blindfold him\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nBoskos thromuldo boskos.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nI know you are the Muskos' regiment:\\nAnd I shall lose my life for want of language;\\nIf there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,\\nItalian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll\\nDiscover that which shall undo the Florentine.\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nBoskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak\\nthy tongue.

But, fair soul,\\nIn your fine frame hath love no quality?\\nIf quick fire of youth light not your mind,\\nYou are no maiden, but a monument:\\nWhen you are dead, you should be such a one\\nAs you are now, for you are cold and stem;\\nAnd now you should be as your mother was\\nWhen your sweet self was got.\\n\\nDIANA\\n\\nShe then was honest.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nSo should you be.\\n\\nDIANA\\n\\nNo:\\nMy mother did but duty; such, my lord,\\nAs you owe to your wife.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nNo more o' that;\\nI prithee, do not strive against my vows:\\nI was compell'd to her; but I love thee\\nBy love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever\\nDo thee all rights of service.\\n\\nDIANA\\n\\nAy, so you serve us\\nTill we serve you; but when you have our roses,\\nYou barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves\\nAnd mock us with our bareness.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nHow have I sworn!\\n\\nDIANA\\n\\n'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,\\nBut the plain single vow that is vow'd true.\\nWhat is not holy, that we swear not by,\\nBut take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,\\nIf I should swear by God's great attributes,\\nI loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,\\nWhen I did love you ill? This has no holding,\\nTo swear by him whom I protest to love,\\nThat I will work against him: therefore your oaths\\nAre words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,\\nAt least in my opinion.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nChange it, change it;\\nBe not so holy-cruel: love is holy;\\nAnd my integrity ne'er knew the crafts\\nThat you do charge men with.

Since Frenchmen are so braid,\\nMarry that will, I live and die a maid:\\nOnly in this disguise I think't no sin\\nTo cozen him that would unjustly win.\\nExit\\n\\nSCENE III. The Florentine camp.\\n\\nEnter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nYou have not given him his mother's letter?\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nI have delivered it an hour since: there is\\nsomething in't that stings his nature; for on the\\nreading it he changed almost into another man.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nHe has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking\\noff so good a wife and so sweet a lady.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nEspecially he hath incurred the everlasting\\ndispleasure of the king, who had even tuned his\\nbounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a\\nthing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nWhen you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the\\ngrave of it.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nHe hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in\\nFlorence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he\\nfleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath\\ngiven her his monumental ring, and thinks himself\\nmade in the unchaste composition.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nNow, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,\\nwhat things are we!\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nMerely our own traitors. And as in the common course\\nof all treasons, we still see them reveal\\nthemselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,\\nso he that in this action contrives against his own\\nnobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nIs it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of\\nour unlawful intents? We shall not then have his\\ncompany to-night?\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nNot till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nThat approaches apace; I would gladly have him see\\nhis company anatomized, that he might take a measure\\nof his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had\\nset this counterfeit.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nWe will not meddle with him till he come; for his\\npresence must be the whip of the other.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nIn the mean time, what hear you of these wars?\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nI hear there is an overture of peace.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nNay, I assure you, a peace concluded.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nWhat will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel\\nhigher, or return again into France?\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nI perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether\\nof his council.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nLet it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal\\nof his act.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nSir, his wife some two months since fled from his\\nhouse: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques\\nle Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere\\nsanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the\\ntenderness of her nature became as a prey to her\\ngrief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and\\nnow she sings in heaven.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nHow is this justified?\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nThe stronger part of it by her own letters, which\\nmakes her story true, even to the point of her\\ndeath: her death itself, which could not be her\\noffice to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by\\nthe rector of the place.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nHath the count all this intelligence?\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nAy, and the particular confirmations, point from\\npoint, so to the full arming of the verity.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nI am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nHow mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nAnd how mightily some other times we drown our gain\\nin tears! The great dignity that his valour hath\\nhere acquired for him shall at home be encountered\\nwith a shame as ample.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and\\nill together: our virtues would be proud, if our\\nfaults whipped them not; and our crimes would\\ndespair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.\\nEnter a Messenger\\nHow now! where's your master?\\n\\nServant\\n\\nHe met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath\\ntaken a solemn leave: his lordship will next\\nmorning for France. The duke hath offered him\\nletters of commendations to the king.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nThey shall be no more than needful there, if they\\nwere more than they can commend.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nThey cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.\\nHere's his lordship now.\\nEnter BERTRAM\\nHow now, my lord! is't not after midnight?\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nI have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a\\nmonth's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:\\nI have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his\\nnearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my\\nlady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;\\nand between these main parcels of dispatch effected\\nmany nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but\\nthat I have not ended yet.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nIf the business be of any difficulty, and this\\nmorning your departure hence, it requires haste of\\nyour lordship.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nI mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to\\nhear of it hereafter. But shall we have this\\ndialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,\\nbring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived\\nme, like a double-meaning prophesier.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nBring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,\\npoor gallant knave.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nNo matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping\\nhis spurs so long. How does he carry himself?\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nI have told your lordship already, the stocks carry\\nhim. But to answer you as you would be understood;\\nhe weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he\\nhath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes\\nto be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to\\nthis very instant disaster of his setting i' the\\nstocks: and what think you he hath confessed?\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nNothing of me, has a'?\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nHis confession is taken, and it shall be read to his\\nface: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you\\nare, you must have the patience to hear it.\\nEnter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nA plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of\\nme: hush, hush!\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nHoodman comes! Portotartarosa\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nHe calls for the tortures: what will you say\\nwithout 'em?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nI will confess what I know without constraint: if\\nye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nBosko chimurcho.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nBoblibindo chicurmurco.\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nYou are a merciful general.

What say you to that?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nFive or six thousand; but very weak and\\nunserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and\\nthe commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation\\nand credit and as I hope to live.\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nShall I set down your answer so?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nDo: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nAll's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nYou're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur\\nParolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own\\nphrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the\\nknot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of\\nhis dagger.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nI will never trust a man again for keeping his sword\\nclean. nor believe he can have every thing in him\\nby wearing his apparel neatly.\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nWell, that's set down.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nFive or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say\\ntrue,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nHe's very near the truth in this.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nBut I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he\\ndelivers it.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nPoor rogues, I pray you, say.\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\nWell, that's set down.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nI humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the\\nrogues are marvellous poor.\\n\\nFirst Soldier\\n\\n[Reads]  'Demand of him, of what strength they are\\na-foot.' What say you to that?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nBy my troth, sir, if I were to live this present\\nhour, I will tell true.
